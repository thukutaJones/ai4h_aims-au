    """Base LightningModule (model) interface.

    Using this interface is not mandatory for experiments in this framework, but it will help log
    and debug basic batch-related issues. It also exposes a few of the useful (but rarely remembered)
    features that the base LightningModule implementation supports, such as metrics that can be
    stored/reloaded inside checkpoints.

    The main (not-mandatory-but-still-useful) feature offered here is the ability to 'render' the
    same batches (with predictions) every epoch based on their IDs. The way this is done is by first
    trying to find out the data loader batch size and the expected batch count. Given this, we pick
    a random set samples based on the total expected number of samples (batch size x data loader
    length) we will see. Each time we see one of these picked samples for the first time, we
    memorize its real batch identifier, and render it. In subsequent epochs, we check for the batch
    identifier directly, and re-render the same samples we saw in the past. This might break with
    variable-length or iterator-based data loaders, and should be disabled in that case (by setting
    `sample_count_to_render=0` in the constructor). With combined data loaders or data loaders that
    work with varying batch lengths, it might not always be able to find/render as many samples
    as the requested number, so see the `sample_count_to_render` as an optimistic upper bound.

    Note that regarding the usage of torchmetrics, there are some pitfalls to avoid e.g. when
    using multiple data loaders; refer to the following link for more information:
        https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pages/lightning.html#common-pitfalls

                training is never expected, can be `None`.
            log_train_metrics_each_step: toggles whether the metrics should be computed and logged
                each step in the training loop (true), or whether we should accumulate predictions
                and targets and only compute/log the metrics at the end of the epoch (false) as in
                the validation and testing loops. Defaults to false. When the predictions take a lot
                of memory (e.g. when doing semantic image segmentation with many classes), it might
                be best to turn this off to avoid out-of-memory errors when running long epochs, or
                drastic slowdowns when complex metrics are used.
            log_train_batch_size_each_step: toggles whether the batch size that are seen during
                the training loop should be logged at every step or not. This is useful to monitor
                varying batch sizes during training.
            sample_count_to_render: number of samples that should (ideally) be rendered using the
                internal rendering function (if any is defined). Note that if the dataset is too
                small or if we do not have a reliable way to get good persistent IDs for data
                samples, we might be forced to render fewer samples than the number specified here.
            log_metrics_in_loop_types: defines the sequence of loop types (e.g. "train", "valid",
                and "test") for which we should compute metrics. The default covers all loop types
                where we can expect to have target labels.
            batch_size_hints: for each data loader type, provides a hint for the batch sizes we
